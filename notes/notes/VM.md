- The virtual machine will run off of a stack. The stack is supported with a "value" array in which values are stored through indexing. Thus, when a value is required, it can be called upon from the bytecode as an integer. The main limitation of the size of this array. However, this "value" array is truly only responsible for holding constants, any value (most) that are stored in variables are accessed through RAM.
